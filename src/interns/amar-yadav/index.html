      <p> Having used email services such as SendGrid to automate emails in my previous role as a Full Stack Developer, I was always curious to see how such extensive email services work. I wondered what goes behind such robust and reliable APIs that helped me complete my work with ease.
        I'm pretty sure teams at Lob have developed powerful tools and APIs to take it even a step further with physical mails. That is what I want to see up close, investigate and maybe contribute as well. </p>
      <p> For me, being a software developer means developing tools that make everyone's lives around me easier without them worrying about what's under the hood. It begins with writing clean and lucid code so that my co-workers can understand, communicate effectively as a team member to function as a focused team player, and finally deliver software that delights the customer. </p>
      <p> I strive for simplicity that inspires. I would love to create software that hides complexity in a simple, scalable, and reliable way. It would be an excellent opportunity to work on powerful REST APIs, the invisible backend, and the frontend that enables a customer to design workflows that automate everyday monumental tasks with ease. </p>
